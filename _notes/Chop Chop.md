Chop Chop was one of the first on-demand grocery apps.

It was developed by Sainsbury's alongside [[Pivotal Labs]]. We ran a blended team which started out with mostly Pivots pairing with a few Sainsbury's staff, and over time reducing the number of Pivots and increasing the number of Sainsbury's staff. [[Anna]] was the product manager on the Pivotal side, also working with [[Papa Akuffo]].

We ran a lean-agile approach with regular research feeding into product development and a tight design-development cycle. We started iOS only while establishing product market fit (we launched in one store before expanding to two, and the goal after launch was 50 orders per store per day).

We ran workshops on opportunity areas we'd discovered through usage data.

We played around with the unit economics and the levers within our control - like delivery fee. When we switched the delivery fee to £0 from £5 as an experiment, we pretty much broke the service - not only were we overrun with orders, but anyone could order, forget something, and place another order with just two items in it.

We probably should have seen that coming. Everyone got their groceries eventually. And we found a *lot* of bugs and service failures in the process.
