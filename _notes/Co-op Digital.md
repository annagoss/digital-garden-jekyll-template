Co-op Digital was set up in [[2015]] by the same people who started [[GDS]] - [[Tom Loosemore]], [[Ben Terrett]] and [[Mike Bracken]]. ([[Russell Davies]] was there for a bit too but we both missed him)

[[Anna]] and [[Eliot]] both worked there in [[2017]] along with [[Tom Taylor]], [[Ian Drysdale]], [[Ella Fitzsimmons]], [[Kim Morley]], [[Jo Scho]] and [[Andrew Travers]].
