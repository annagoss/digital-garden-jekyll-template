Anna is a director at [[FF Studio]] along with [[Eliot]].

She's worked at [[GDS]], [[Co-op Digital]], [[Pivotal Labs]], [[With Associates]] and [[Gail's Bakery]].

At [[GDS]] she was head of design on [[GOV.UK Verify]], the UK government's digital identity product (since replaced by [GOV.UK One Login]([https://www.sign-in.service.gov.uk/](GOV.UK One Login))). She's probably more paranoid than most about identity theft as a result. She went on to work in GDS's international team, consulting with governments in Uzbekistan, Montenegro, Bosnia & Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Colombia and Argentina and helping them to answer the question "how do we get a GOV.UK?". When COVID-19 kicked off and flights got cancelled while governments paused reform agendas, Anna joined GOV.UK to lead on work around the [[GOV.UK Account]].

As a freelancer between [[2021]] and [[2023]], she worked on a variety of projects, mostly with [[Public Digital]]. This included a research project for the [[Premier League]] on the impact of COVID-19 on stadium safety and club operations, and helping the [[British Library]] scope the work and hire a team for a single digital presence for libraries.

Anna writes a newsletter called [Checksies](https://www.checksies.com) with [[Rod McLaren]]. She lives in Brighton with her partner and has a dog called Pepsi.
